# CS320

In this project to ensure that I was delivering clean, efficient, and functional code, I took a TDD approach to Unit and Integration Testing.
I wrote out test cases for all business requirements that were given along with this project and ensured that all CRUD functionality was there and 
also working through Postman. In order to interpret the client/user needs, I followed along with the documentation, carefully reading and understanding
exactly what this application needed to do and why. I made a few small improvements as well using the spring framework for added security. 
In the approach to design this, I found a lot of previous knowledge in Spring would be applicable since the app requirements are pretty basic at this
stage. However, on a larger project, the same approach would take place where all the client/business requirements would be thouroughly examined and then
a team of lead engineers, project managers, and architects would come together to decide exactly what technologies, frameworks and other tools would be
best for the project.
